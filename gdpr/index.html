In order to allow you to exercise these rights, Mobikom made changes so you can now better control your data on the app.

Before we elaborate how you can exercise your GDPR rights, we want to remind you of the additional rights Mobikom users enjoy just by being Mobikom users.

The right to private and secure chats
The Mobikom standard: We can’t read or listen to any of your private chats and calls because they are protected by end-to-end encryption by default. On Mobikom it is automatically in place from as soon as you start sending messages or making calls with the app without any need for you to turn on your encryption settings. Mobikom can’t sell your privacy, simply because we can’t access your private chats.

The right to delete messages you regret sending
Mobikom lets you delete any type of message you’ve sent for both yourself and the people you’ve sent it to. This means whatever you decided to delete will no longer appear on your device or on your friend’s device, even if they have already seen it. You don’t even have to worry about how long it’s been since you sent your message since you can delete at any time.

The right to send disappearing messages with a self-destruct timer
When you have something extra sensitive to say, Secret Chats let you set a self-destruct timer for every message in the conversation. Every message in a Secret Chat is automatically deleted from all members’ of the chat’s phones once it has been read. Secret Chats also have inbuilt screenshot protection – Android users can’t take a screenshot, and if someone on an iPhone takes a screenshot, you will receive a notification.

The right to keep your personal chats your own
Mobikom doesn’t store your personal chats. Messages that are delivered aren’t copied onto Mobikom’s servers. If your friend’s phone is off or they don’t have an internet connection, your message will wait patiently, safe and encrypted, on Mobikom’s servers for a limited time or until their device is ready to receive it.

And let’s not forget about the GDPR
The right to be informed
Mobikom’s privacy policy describes our practices in detail using simple language. Everything you need to know is here. If you have more questions, feel free to contact our support team.

The right to rectification
If you believe we have the wrong data about you, or that your data is incomplete, feel free to change it at any time through the profile settings on your Viber settings on your mobile device. If you can’t find what you are looking for, contact us.

The right to erasure
We have made it easy for you to delete your historical data on the app, while continuing to use the app. Simply tap on the delete your data button in your privacy settings. We will delete the data which we are not otherwise required to keep or is necessary for the provision of the service. And no need to worry – deleting your data won’t remove the chats on your Mobikom app on your phone.

Note that when you deactivate the Mobikom account your data and chats are automatically deleted from your devices.

The right to restrict processing
We allow you to opt out of certain processing of your data by using the Mobikom privacy settings on your mobile device. You can decide which processing operations you want to opt-out of. You can also change the settings on your mobile device operating system at any time to prevent us gaining access to certain data such as your accurate location – but this may negatively impact on your user experience.

The right to data portability
We have created a request your data button in Viber’s privacy settings on your mobile device to make a simple way for you to access the data connected to your account. Once it is ready, you will receive a file from Mobikom containing this data.

The right of access
Read our privacy policy for details about what data is processed by us. Access this data by using the request your data button in Viber’s privacy settings on your mobile device. If you have further questions contact us.

The right to object
On top of the ability to opt out of processing by changing your settings, you can object to the processing of certain forms of data by contacting our support. Complete this online form and explain your special circumstances. If you receive emails from us, you can always opt out on the bottom of the email, or by contacting our support.

The right to appeal automated decisions and profiling
We may make an automated decision to block a user, in case we suspect this user is using our services for illegal acts or acts that violate our terms of use. If you believe that your account was unlawfully blocked, you can contact our support team.

We protect children
Mobikom welcomes young users between the ages of 13 and 16. Children’s privacy settings are set by default to the most protective settings and can’t be changed until the user reaches 16 years of age. This way, users between the ages of 13 and 16, can safely use our services with enhanced protection by us.<p><a href=/advertising/ title=mobikom.bg/advertising>Advertise Here</a></p><h3>Bestjobs</h3><p> sophisticated job board will help you turn your job into a career.
